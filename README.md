# Mini Secrets 🤭

Secrete is a mini app for keeping personal secrets 🤐

Own this repository by cloning it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LabyKreative/Secrets.git
```

then install node modules:

```sh
npm install
```

You also need to get some google developer oauth i.e. client id and secrete key for user authentication to run the app

## Cheers! 🥳 & Happy coding! 🤗
